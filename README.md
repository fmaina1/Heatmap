# Heatmap of Naivasha using Folium and Google Colab

This project is an exploration of geographical data visualization using Python's Folium library in Google Colab. The main goal of this project is to generate an interactive heatmap of Naivasha, a beautiful town located in Kenya. The heatmap illustrates Fueling Stations' density across the town, providing a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing spatial data patterns.
